The mipmap-xxhdpi directory is typically used to store launcher icons for xxhdpi screen density. Since this directory is meant for image resources, it should contain image files (e.g., PNG files) for the app's launcher icon. However, as you requested the contents of the directory, I will provide a comment indicating that this directory is intended for image resources.

# This directory is intended for xxhdpi launcher icon images. Please add your image files here.
