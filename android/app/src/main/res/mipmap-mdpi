The mipmap-mdpi directory is typically used to store launcher icons for the app. Since you haven't specified any particular icons to include, I will create a placeholder file structure for the mipmap-mdpi directory. 

Here are the contents for the directory:

/hair_care_app/hair_care_app/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi:
- ic_launcher.png (Placeholder for the app launcher icon)
- ic_launcher_round.png (Placeholder for the round app launcher icon)

You can replace these placeholder files with your actual launcher icons later.

Please create the following files in the mipmap-mdpi directory:

1. ic_launcher.png
2. ic_launcher_round.png

Both files can be intentionally left blank for now, as they are placeholders. 

The contents of the files will be:

/hair_care_app/hair_care_app/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png:
<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. -->

/hair_care_app/hair_care_app/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher_round.png:
<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. -->
