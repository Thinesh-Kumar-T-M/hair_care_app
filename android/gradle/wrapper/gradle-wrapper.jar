The gradle-wrapper.jar file is a binary file that is generated by the Gradle build system and cannot be manually created or edited. It is typically included in a project when you set up the Gradle wrapper. 

To obtain the gradle-wrapper.jar file, you can create a new Flutter project or run the command `flutter create .` in your existing project directory, which will generate the necessary Gradle wrapper files, including gradle-wrapper.jar.

If you need to include this file in your project, please ensure you have the Gradle wrapper set up correctly by following the above steps.
